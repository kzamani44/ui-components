## Reusable UI-components & templates
This repository is a collection of private UI components intended to ease the time and delivery of projects

### ðŸŸ© Goal/Aim
As projects and jobs keep coming in, creating pieces from scratch becomes a bore when you mostly just want to go straight into the main functionalities of the project.
Also, most web apps typically have the same structure like a Navbar at the top of the Page, a Footer at the bottom of the page and the main content in between.
 So the goal here is to create sort of a library or store for those components or designs that can be copied when needed.

> NOTE: This is not an avenue to make a developer lazy but just speed development process by cutting down the time it takes to build these components for every project
